# A simple Tic Tac Toe game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game written in React Native. It is a simple game that can be played by two players. The game is played on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
